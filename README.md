# Web Design Project

This project is about learning common web design principles and following a framework that allows you to build professional looking websites.

As taught on the Udemy course: [Building Responsive Websites using HTML and CSS](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/)

### The framework consists of 9 different areas of design:

2. [Colors](#colors)
3. [Images](#images)
4. [Icons](#icons)
5. [Shadows](#shadows)
6. [Border-Radius](#border-radius)
7. [Whitespace](#whitespace)
8. [Visual Hierarchy](#visual-hierarchy)
9. [User Experience](#user-experience)

## Typography

### Using Good Typefaces

- Choose between a serif and sans-serif typeface according to the website personality
- Limit the use of typefaces to 2 different ones per page

### Using Good Font Sizes and Weights

- For normal text, use a font size between 16px and 32px
- For long text, use a font size of 20px or more
- For headings, use a font size of 50px or more and a font weight of 600 or more
- Never use font weight under 400 as the text becomes unreadable

### Creating a Good Reading Experience

- Limit characters to 75 per line
- For normal-sized text, use a line height between 1.5 and 2
- For bigger text, use a line height below 1.5
- Decrease letter spacing in unnatural looking headlines
- Use uppercase letters for short titles and experiment with font weight and letter spacing
- Never justify or center long text blocks

## Colors

### Choosing the Right Color

- The main color should match the website's personality
  - Colors convey meaning, for example: red symbolizes power, orange conveys happiness and green represents harmony
- Select a good color tone using various online tools such as [OpenColor](https://yeun.github.io/open-color/) or [Flat UI Colors](https://flatuicolors.com/)

### Establishing a Color System

- Your color palette should include a **main color** and a **grey color**
  - The **grey color** does not have to be a _true grey_, it can also be a very dark version of another color
- An **accent color** can be added to complement the main color
- Create _lighter (tints)_ and _darker (shades)_ versions of the selected colors for more diversity
- Tools such as [Palleton](https://palleton.com/) or [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) can be used to generate color palettes

### Using Colors

- The **main color** is used to draw attention to the most important elements on the page
- An interesting **accent color** can make entire components or sections stand out
- Color can also be used strategically using images and illustrations

### Colors and Typography

- Try to use a _tint_ of dark colored backgrounds for the text displayed on top
- Text should never be completely black, use lighter colors if it looks heavy and uninviting
- Never make text too light, always aim for a good contrast ratio betweeen text and background colors to make it more accessible

## Images

### Types of Images

- **Product Photos** illustrate products the website is trying to sell
- **Storytelling Photos** show other people using the product or convey a message about the website
- **Illustrations** are a more abstract way of storytelling through 2D or 3D illustration
- **Patterns** are used for interesting visual details

### Finding Good Images

- Use only relevant images that support your website's message and story
- Always use original looking stock images and avoid generic ones
- Some free stock image websites include: [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) and [unDraw](https://undraw.co/)

### Using Images

- Try to show images about _real people_ that the user can connect to
- If necessary, crop images to fit your messages
- Experiment with combining photos, illustrations and patterns

### Handling Text on Images

- **Method #1 :** Darken or brighten the image, partially or completely, using a gradient
- **Method #2 :** Position the text into a neutral area but be careful of image sizes on mobile devices
- **Method #3 :** Put the text in a box, usually with a transparent background

## Icons

### Finding Good Icons

- Find a good icon pack from [Icons8](https://icons8.com/) or use [Phosphor Icons](https://phosphoricons.com/)
- Never mix icons from different icon packs as they can stand out from the rest
- Always use SVG or icon fonts
- Icon roundness, weight and line style depends on the typography of the website

### Using Icons

- Icons can be used:
  - To provide visual assistance to text
  - To convey meaning in product feature blocks
  - To associate with actions, in such cases they should always be labeled
  - To appear as bullet points in lists
- To keep icons neutral, they should have same color as the text
- To draw attention to icons, they should have a different color
- The icon should always fit the text or action it is associated with
- Icons should never be larger than what they were designed for. If necessary, they should be enclosed in a shape
