# Web Design Project

This project is about learning common web design principles and following a framework that allows you to build professional looking websites.

As taught on the Udemy course: [Building Responsive Websites using HTML and CSS](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/)

### The framework consists of 9 different areas of design:

1. [Typography](#typography)
2. [Colors](#colors)
3. [Illustrations](#colors)
4. [Icons](#colors)
5. [Shadows](#colors)
6. [Border-radius](#colors)
7. [Whitespace](#colors)
8. [Visual Hierarchy](#colors)
9. [User Experience](#colors)

## Typography

### Using Good Typefaces

- Choose between a serif and sans-serif typeface according to the website personality
- Limit the use of typefaces to 2 different ones per page

### Using Good Font Sizes and Weights

- For normal text, use a font size between 16px and 32px
- For long text, use a font size of 20px or more
- For headings, use a font size of 50px or more and a font weight of 600 or more
- Never use font weight under 400 as the text becomes unreadable

### Creating a Good Reading Experience

- Limit characters to 75 per line
- For normal-sized text, use a line height between 1.5 and 2
- For bigger text, use a line height below 1.5
- Decrease letter spacing in unnatural looking headlines
- Use uppercase letters for short titles and experiment with font weight and letter spacing
- Never justify or center long text blocks

## Colors

### Choosing the Right Color

- The main color should match the website's personality
  - Colors convey meaning, for example: red symbolizes power, orange conveys happiness and green represents harmony
- Select a good color tone using various online tools such as [OpenColor](https://yeun.github.io/open-color/) or [Flat UI Colors](https://flatuicolors.com/)

### Establishing a Color System

- Your color palette should include a **main color** and a **grey color**
  - The **grey color** does not have to be a _true grey_, it can also be a very dark version of another color
- An **accent color** can be added to complement the main color
- Create _lighter (tints)_ and _darker (shades)_ versions of the selected colors for more diversity
- Tools such as [Palleton](https://palleton.com/) or [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) can be used to generate color palettes

### Using Colors

- The **main color** is used to draw attention to the most important elements on the page
- An interesting **accent color** can make entire components or sections stand out
- Color can also be used strategically using images and illustrations

### Colors and Typography

- Try to use a _tint_ of dark colored backgrounds for the text displayed on top
- Text should never be completely black, use lighter colors if it looks heavy and uninviting
- Never make text too light, always aim for a good contrast ratio betweeen text and background colors to make it more accessible
